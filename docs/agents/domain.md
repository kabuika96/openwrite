# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- `CONTEXT.md` at the repo root.
- `docs/adr/` for ADRs that touch the area about to change.

If any of these files do not exist, proceed silently. The producer skill (`grill-with-docs`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

This is a single-context repo:

```text
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
└── frontend/
└── backend/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When output names a domain concept in an issue title, refactor proposal, hypothesis, or test name, use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Do not drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept needed is not in the glossary yet, note it for `grill-with-docs`.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding.
